# What is Collaboration?

<b>collaboration:</b> <i>noun</i> the action of working with someone to produce or create something

If we can define what collaboration is, and what skills are required to ensure quality collaboration, then we can build learning environments and activities to develop those skills in our learners.

* How is individual accountability defined for 21CLD collaboration? Can you give an example?
* How is substantive decision making defined for 21CLD collaboration? Can you give an example?
* How is interdependence defined for 21CLD collaboration? Can you give an example?

* Are students working with others in a quality collaborative activity?

## Levels of Collaboration

With shared responsibility, make decsions together, students will need to have the following collaboration skills:
* Negotiations
* Conflict Resolution
* Agreement on what must be done
* Listening to the ideas of others
* Distribution of tasks
* Integration of ideas into a coherent whole

### Questions to consider during the design of a collaborative activity
* Are the learners working together?
* Do they have shared responsibility?
* Do they make substantive decsions?
* Is their work interdependent?

**Working together:** students work in pairs or groups to:
* discuss an issue
* solve a problem
* develop a product

* Working with others could include students from another class, students from another school, community members, expers
* Face-to-face or using technology

* Class discussions
* Uses Skype
* Shares OneNote books

#### Shared responsiblity
When students work together to develop a common product, design, or response
* More then just helping each other
* Students must collectively own the work and be mutually responsible

Is this shared responsibilty?
* students conduct a lab experiment together
* give each other feedback
* a student works with a peer in another country to develop a web site
* a student interviews a peer in another country about the local weather

Feedback? One student owns the work. How could this task be redesigned?

#### Making Substantive Decisions Together

Content, Process, or Product

* Academic content of work they create
* Process: They muyst plan, choose tools, and define roles
* Product: fundamental design descisions about the product they are working on

Working in teams to prepare a debate and decide which side of the debate to take?
Choose which animal they will choose to study?
Deciding on their own roles?
Team members assigns roles?
Pairs of students select a colour scheme?

#### Interdependent Work
* In practice, work is not divided fairly
* Students must be required to produce and **interdependent** product
* Or interdependent outcomes: distributing information across all students

#### Individual Accountability
* Each member is responsible for a task that he/she must complete
* Also group accountability: negotiate and agree on process, design, and conclusions of their work

Each student a page? Not interdependent.

Only if students work contribute together.

**Classroom idea**: Students work together to create a webpage about the history, culture, attractions, or accomodations of their local area that will be linked to the class homepage? Or city webpage?

## Decision Tree and Rubrics
* A visual way to represent the definition of an idea or topic.
* Provides a framework

Students are required to work in groups?
Students have shared responsibilty?
Students make substantive decisions together?
Students' work is interdependent?

Include learning activites at all levels over the year. Use *planned* learning outcomes.

The number is a code, not a score or value judgement.

Is the group required to work in pairs? No -> 1
